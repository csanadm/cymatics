# Cymatics
In this cymatics project library resonance patterns are analyzed versius various parameters. 
## Contents
- <a href="https://github.com/csanadm/cymatics/blob/main/analyze.py">analyze.py</a>: analyzing an Excel file with `DataFrame` (from `pandas`), by investigating dependence of the symmetry-fold on the parameters, and doing a linear regression to see r-values.
- <a href="https://github.com/csanadm/cymatics/blob/main/fit.py">fit.py</a>: perform an actual fit with `lmfit`, to see if there is a linear form based on the parameters that successfully predicts the symmetry-fold.
- <a href="https://github.com/csanadm/cymatics/blob/main/machine_learning_prediction.py">machine_learning_prediction.py</a>: perform a machine learning linear regression with `scikit-learn`.
